## About the Project
  
Code & Conquer, heavily inspired by Reeborg's World, is an educational programming game in which players write real code (C++ or Python) to control a character navigating an isometric world. Catering towards older high school and college-aged beginners, the platform exposes users to features common in desktop IDEs. Our goal is to foster creative problem-solving by providing a fun and engaging way to learn programming fundamentals.
 
**Key features:**
- Built-in code editor with syntax highlighting, execution cursor, and step-by-step debug mode (C++ and Python)
- Sandboxed code execution environment — validates and restricts student-submitted code before compilation, blocking OS-level commands and dynamic memory allocation
- Real-time character simulation on a 2D isometric grid with rotatable camera (90° increments)
- Native OS file dialog integration with JSON file filtering for level import
- Split-pane workstation layout with synchronized step execution between the code interpreter and live game subviewport
- Runtime JSON level loading with full Reeborg's World format compatibility

## Download & Play
 
Just want to play? Download a pre-built executable — no Godot required:
 
Head to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/MakariousS44/Code-and-Conquer/releases/tag/v1.0.0) page and grab the latest build for your OS:
- **Windows** — `CodeAndConquer_Windows.zip`
- **macOS** — `CodeAndConquer_MacOS.zip`
- **Linux** — `CodeAndConquer_Linux.zip`
  
Unzip and run the executable.
 
> **Note:** GCC (g++) and Python 3 are required to compile and run student code. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) below.

## Getting Started (Developers)
 
### Prerequisites
 
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
 
**Git** — [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)
 
**Godot Engine** — Currently using Godot 4.6.1.
- [For Windows](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/)
- [For Linux](https://godotengine.org/download/linux/)
- [For MacOS](https://godotengine.org/download/macos/)
Godot is downloaded as an executable inside a zip file. To start Godot, unzip and run the executable.
 
**GCC (g++)** — Required to compile C++ student code at runtime.
- Windows: Install via [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) or [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
- Linux/macOS: Usually pre-installed. Run `g++ --version` to verify.

**Python 3** — Required to run Python student code at runtime.
- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Run `python3 --version` to verify.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
 
To get a local copy of the project, clone the repository using your terminal or a Git GUI.
 
1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
3. Run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yoshibar-003/Code-and-Conquer.git
```
 
Once the download is complete, a new folder named after the project will be created.
 
---
 
### Step 2: Import the Project into Godot
 
Godot does not automatically detect new folders on your drive; you must manually point the Project Manager to the cloned directory.
 
1. Launch the Godot Engine.
2. In the Project Manager window, click the `Import Existing Project` button in the center or the `Import` button on the top-left.
3. Navigate into the folder you just cloned and look for the **project.godot** file.
   - Note: The project.godot file is the brain of the project. Godot cannot import a folder unless this file is present in the root.
4. Select the file, open, and import.
---
 
### Step 3: Run the Project
 
Press **F5** or click the **Play** button in the top-right of the Godot editor.
 
---
 
## How to Play
 
1. Write C++ or Python code in the **Editor** panel on the left. Use the language selector in the top-right to switch languages.
2. Click **Run** to compile and execute your code — watch the character move!
3. Click **>>** to execute one command at a time.
4. Click **<<** to go back one command at a time.
5. Click **Reset** to reload the world and start over.

## Available Commands & Sensors
 
These robot functions work the same in both C++ and Python.
 
### Commands (perform an action)
 
```cpp
move();          // Move the character one tile forward
turn_left();     // Rotate the character 90° to the left
pick_object();   // Pick up an object on the current tile
put_object();    // Place an object on the current tile
```
 
### Sensors (return `true` or `false`)
 
```cpp
front_is_clear();   // No wall directly ahead
right_is_clear();   // No wall to the character's right
left_is_clear();    // No wall to the character's left
wall_in_front();    // Wall directly ahead
wall_on_right();    // Wall to the character's right
wall_on_left();     // Wall to the character's left
at_goal();          // Character is standing on the goal tile
object_here();      // An object is on the current tile
carries_object();   // Robot is carrying an object
is_facing_north();  // Robot is currently facing north
is_facing_east();  // Robot is currently facing east
is_facing_west();  // Robot is currently facing west
```
 
**Example — walk in a square:**
```cpp
int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        move();
        move();
        move();
        turn_left();
    }
}
```
